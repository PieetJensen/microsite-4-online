     <div class="box">Do you remember when you ﬁrst took a ride on your bike? I remember that day, it was truly idyllic summer’s afternoon and 7 years old me was ready. Ready to take her ﬁrst ride, maybe fall again but then get up and try again. As many times as it takes. I remember happy faces of my parents when they ﬁrst saw me riding my bike on my own. For 7 year old, this was the achievement, highlight of the summer. You might remember it too, for many people bikes are not only the way of transportation but rather moment of total freedom - ﬁnding your inner child again.  </div>


     <div class="box">Bikes are irreplaceable part of Copenhagen, making the city vibrant, alive and green. Copenhageners love their bikes. Cycling is fast, convenient, healthy, climate-friendly, enjoyable - and cheap, although Copenhageners honestly love their bikes no matter their ﬁnancial income. Copenhagen is a city that invites you to cycle.  It is simply our way of life and if you want to experience real Copenhagen just to jump in the saddle.  </div>
